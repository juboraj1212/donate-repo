        <h1>Their tearful eyes look at us </h1>
        <p>With homes crushed, objects floating away and people missing, the country is at high alert. This is not the first
            time
            the northeastern region (Sylhet) of Bangladesh is experiencing these floods, which have occurred twice already
            in
            2022
            alone. Now, they have begun again, starting in May 2022 with heavy rains battering the area, rivers overflowing,
            and
            excess water sweeping through the region. Since 17th June, the situation has dramatically worsened and affected
            additional districts, increasing the magnitude and scale of damage.

        <h1>We should share their sufferings</h1>
        <p>Doctors Worldwide is currently working to provide a floating medical boat in a number of key  areas starting with
            Beanibazar and Boroleka Upazila (administrative areas) after which we will expand into the other Upazilas. These
            areas
            have not received as much support from private, public and government agencies as Sylhet city and the Sunamganj
            district. The medical boat will travel to shelters and marooned families to treat sick patients who currently do
            not
            have access to medical care.
